# Uses:   ALAN Network Signature Analysis of ALAN dataset
#
# Purpose: This script extracts genes of interest from ALAN Export - Matrix 2 dataset and 
#          assignes a threshold to determine an ALAN Network Signature
#
#   Inputs:
#   1)  ALAN2 Output csv file of correlation coefficients
#       "data_ALAN2.csv" - ALAN2 outpt from gene expression dataset
#                        - Each row represents a gene
#                        - Each column represents a gene
#                        - First column contains gene symbols
#                        - First row contains gene symbols
#
#   2) Primary gene of interest: Define this at the top of the script (goi <- "[myGene]")
#       This must be saved as a character to the variable "goi"
#   
#   3) List of genes to compare: Define this at the top of the script 
#       This must be saved as a character or list of characters to the variable "goi_list"
#
# Outputs:
#   1) "data_ALAN2_GOI.csv" 
#       CSV file of the gene network correlation coefficients between the list of genes of interest
#       and genes associated with the primary gene of interest
